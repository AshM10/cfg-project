## CFG PRESENTATION TAKEAWAY

### What went well?
- I love coding in general so I definitely enjoyed doing this project. It seems like time went by fast while coding, and I get the feeling of satisfaction when I create the website design that I like.

### What were the challenges?
- It was a challenge to make the website responsive, it works fine on iOs but when I use chrome browsers, the css margins are misaligned. Also oftentimes, when I revisit my project, the css seems to be running funny.

### How will you expand your current project?
- I definitely need to add three more pages and link them to the navigation bar. I also need to integrate more JavaScript in the gallery page so I can store data (art photos) in a directory and map through them and pass it to the DOM.
